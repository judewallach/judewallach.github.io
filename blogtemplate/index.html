          <p>That easy. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. Let's go up in here, and start having some fun

Just beat the devil out of it. It's life. It's interesting. It's fun. A tree cannot be straight if it has a crooked trunk.

And just raise cain. Nothing wrong with washing your brush. Take your time. Speed will come later. Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper floating across a mountain.

For the lack of a better word I call them hangy downs. And I will hypnotize that just a little bit. Brown is such a nice color. The light is your friend. Preserve it. Put it in, leave it alone. Now we'll take the almighty fan brush.

Nice little clouds playing around in the sky. Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever it takes. Let your imagination just wonder around when you're doing these things. Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective. Now let's put some happy little clouds in here. Each highlight must have it's own private shadow.

You can get away with a lot. These little son of a guns hide in your brush and you just have to push them out. Paint anything you want on the canvas. Create your own world. Every single thing in the world has its own personality - and it is up to you to make friends with the little rascals. Of course he's a happy little stone, cause we don't have any other kind.

I really recommend you use odorless thinner or your spouse is gonna run you right out into the yard and you'll be working by yourself. Everyone needs a friend. Friends are the most valuable things in the world. Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share it with a friend.
</p>
<p>We don't want to set these clouds on fire. A fan brush can be your best friend. You got your heavy coat out yet? It's getting colder. Now we'll take the almighty fan brush. This is probably the greatest thing that's ever happened in my life.

So often we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of fun. Isn't it great to do something you can't fail at? Tree trunks grow however makes them happy.

Any little thing can be your friend if you let it be. Now it's beginning to make a little sense. This is unplanned it really just happens. If there's two big trees invariably sooner or later there's gonna be a little tree.

Now we don't want him to get lonely, so we'll give him a little friend. The only thing worse than yellow snow is green snow. If you hypnotize it, it will go away. This is truly an almighty mountain. Let your imagination just wonder around when you're doing these things.

In your imagination you can go anywhere you want. It takes dark in order to show light. If we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path.

Just let go - and fall like a little waterfall. From all of us here, I want to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friends. All those little son of a guns. We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here. You have freedom here. The only guide is your heart. We have no limits to our world. We're only limited by our imagination.

Let's make a happy little mountain now. Work that paint. Just think about these things in your mind - then bring them into your world. Here's another little happy bush Imagination is the key to painting.

<p>You have to make those little noises or it won't work. You can bend rivers. But when I get home, the only thing I have power over is the garbage. That's the way I look when I get home late; black and blue. All you need is a dream in your heart, and an almighty knife. You can't have light without dark. You can't know happiness unless you've known sorrow. I thought today we would do a happy little picture.

And maybe a little bush lives there. This is your world, whatever makes you happy you can put in it. Go crazy. All kinds of happy little splashes. See there, told you that would be easy. Now we'll take the almighty fan brush. You want your tree to have some character. Make it special.

A fan brush is a fantastic piece of equipment. Use it. Make friends with it. It's a super day, so why not make a beautiful sky? The little tiny Tim easels will let you down. Here's something that's fun.

We have no limits to our world. We're only limited by our imagination. At home you have unlimited time. Think about a cloud. Just float around and be there. I think there's an artist hidden in the bottom of every single one of us. Let's make a happy little mountain now.

          <p>If there's two big trees invariably sooner or later there's gonna be a little tree. It's all a game of angles. Do an almighty painting with us. Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share it with a friend.

You can do it. You can create anything that makes you happy. You can do anything here. So don't worry about it. This present moment is perfect simply due to the fact you're experiencing it.

If you overwork it you become a cloud killer. There's nothing worse than a cloud killer. You can't make a mistake. Anything that happens you can learn to use - and make something beautiful out of it. Steve wants reflections, so let's give him reflections. You have to make almighty decisions when you're the creator. I was blessed with a very steady hand; and it comes in very handy when you're doing these little delicate things. Let all these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them.

Here's another little happy bush We'll take a little bit of Van Dyke Brown. La- da- da- da- dah. Just be happy.

</p>
<p>Let's build an almighty mountain. When you buy that first tube of paint it gives you an artist license. Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective. I spend a lot of time walking around in the woods and talking to trees, and squirrels, and little rabbits and stuff.

We might as well make some Almighty mountains today as well, what the heck. Zip. That easy. If you don't like it - change it. It's your world. A thin paint will stick to a thick paint. Just use the old one inch brush.

It's cold, but it's beautiful. Without washing the brush, I'm gonna go right into some Van Dyke Brown, some Burnt Umber, and a little bit of Sap Green. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. So often we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of fun. See there how easy that is. I thought today we would make a happy little stream that's just running through the woods here.

Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper floating across a mountain. I really recommend you use odorless thinner or your spouse is gonna run you right out into the yard and you'll be working by yourself. God gave you this gift of imagination. Use it.

Everybody needs a friend. You're the greatest thing that has ever been or ever will be. You're special. You're so very special. In painting, you have unlimited power. You have the ability to move mountains. The least little bit can do so much. The shadows are just like the highlights, but we're going in the opposite direction. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world.

Steve wants reflections, so let's give him reflections. Don't be afraid to make these big decisions. Once you start, they sort of just make themselves. We don't have to be concerned about it. We just have to let it fall where it will. I was blessed with a very steady hand; and it comes in very handy when you're doing these little delicate things. I will take some magic white, and a little bit of Vandyke brown and a little touch of yellow. But they're very easily killed. Clouds are delicate.

</p>
<p>Trees grow however makes them happy. There we are. Clouds are free. They just float around the sky all day and have fun.

I want everbody to be happy. That's what it's all about. There is no right or wrong - as long as it makes you happy and doesn't hurt anyone. If you do too much it's going to lose its effectiveness. Do an almighty painting with us. Don't kill all your dark areas - you need them to show the light. We have a fantastic little sky!
