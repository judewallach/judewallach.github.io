        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends. It's beautiful - and we haven't even done anything to it yet. Let that brush dance around there and play. But they're very easily killed. Clouds are delicate. This is a fantastic little painting.

  Decide where your cloud lives. Maybe he lives right in here. All those little son of a guns. Trees grow however makes them happy. Let's put some highlights on these little trees. The sun wouldn't forget them. And just raise cain.

  Let's make a nice big leafy tree. I can't think of anything more rewarding than being able to express yourself to others through painting. We have a fantastic little sky!</p><br>
  <p>Nature is so fantastic, enjoy it. Let it make you happy. You can bend rivers. But when I get home, the only thing I have power over is the garbage. You've got to learn to fight the temptation to resist these things. Just let them happen. So often we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of fun. Fluff it up a little and hypnotize it. We're not trying to teach you a thing to copy. We're just here to teach you a technique, then let you loose into the world.

And maybe, maybe, maybe... That easy. I think there's an artist hidden in the bottom of every single one of us. Be careful. You can always add more - but you can't take it away.</p>
